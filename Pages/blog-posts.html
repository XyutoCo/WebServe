<center><h2>How I switched from Plusnet to Github</h2></center>
<br><h3>I purchased a domain from <a href="http://www.123-reg.co.uk">123 Reg</a> and I begun hosting my website on plusnet webspace that came with my interent plan but soon found it to be a pain
to FTP every time I wanted to upload something. But it is a great and reliable hosting solution and it's free. Another problem was that it wouldn't mask properly so it looked really unprofessional.
<br>
I decided that I want to change and I looked at dropbox and it seemed good until I realised that Dropbox had stopped the functionalit, scuppering my plan. So I decided to do more reasearch and found GitHub,
it took me a while to get it working due to the fact Hotmail were treating some vital emails as spam but, I managed to get it working and it is a good solution, I can edit from my iPad and iPhone which makes
it really handy and also its completely free.<br></h3><h2>So heres how I did it</h2><br>
<H3>
<ul>
	<li>The first thing I did was make an acount on  <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>.</li>
	<li>Then created a new repository, Some thing short.</li>
	<li>In the settings of this repository press the automatic page generator button input all the information then press publish</li>
	<li>When you look in your repository there is now a lot of information, you can delete this all and put your files in or you can edit the existing files.</li>
	<li>Make sure your homepage is at the index.html</li>
	<li>Your website is now at the url: http://[USERNAME].github.io/[Repository]</li>
	
</ul><br>
	<h3>This should all work but make sure you verify your account and also note it could take ten minutes but for me it took far less than this. <br>
	Thanks<br>

	<center><h2>A webdesigner...</h2></center>
	<br><h3>
YUep thats me... I am officially a webdesigner, with oficial launch of XyutoV3yesterday the pressure is now to write some contenta and for me this is one of the hardest parts, it's not that I can't write english or have trouble doing so; no english is my first language and have been speaking it for years. For most this would seem odd, I hear you saying, surely the programming is the tough bit, well yes and no... I am still learning HTML but I have for the most part nailed the basics which makes the coding part pretty easy so you ask why the content  making is tricky, if you can speak english and HTML is no trouble what is it..? Well it's time... Mostly the lack of it. I do suffer from not  having the time to get the content online because it is time consuming and my life is not just about coding; not yet anyway.<br><br><br>
No in order to get hte content out to you I do have some tricks I have learnt over time, the first is the software I use, when I first started programming, I tested more than my fair share of code editors and after a while a found my favourite: <a href="tecxtmater">TextMate</a>, TextMate is the combination of simplicity and well, simplicity; that's it. It's a free and easy to use text editor, primaraly designed</h3><br>
