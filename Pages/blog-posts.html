<center><h2>How I switched from Plusnet to Github</h2></center>
<br><h3>I purchased a domain from <a href="http://www.123-reg.co.uk">123 Reg</a> and I begun hosting my website on plusnet webspace that came with my interent plan but soon found it to be a pain
to FTP every time I wanted to upload something. But it is a great and reliable hosting solution and it's free. Another problem was that it wouldn't mask properly so it looked really unprofessional.
<br>
I decided that I want to change and I looked at dropbox and it seemed good until I realised that Dropbox had stopped the functionalit, scuppering my plan. So I decided to do more reasearch and found GitHub,
it took me a while to get it working due to the fact Hotmail were treating some vital emails as spam but, I managed to get it working and it is a good solution, I can edit from my iPad and iPhone which makes
it really handy and also its completely free.<br></h3><h2>So heres how I did it</h2><br>
<H3>
<ul>
	<li>The first thing I did was make an acount on  <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>.</li>
	<li>Then created a new repository, Some thing short.</li>
	<li>In the settings of this repository press the automatic page generator button input all the information then press publish</li>
	<li>When you look in your repository there is now a lot of information, you can delete this all and put your files in or you can edit the existing files.</li>
	<li>Make sure your homepage is at the index.html</li>
	<li>Your website is now at the url: http://[USERNAME].github.io/[Repository]</li>
	
</ul><br>
	<h3>This should all work but make sure you verify your account and also note it could take ten minutes but for me it took far less than this. <br>
	Thanks<br>
