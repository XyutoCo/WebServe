			Hello and welcome to Xyuto, this is the company website, I aim to posting content fairly regularly. I hope you enjoy the website. I have some code online and would like to be posting other posts about things other than just code.
<br><br><br>			I am also hoping to post some photos online, wheter that is via twitter or not I am not currently sure.
		<br><br><br>
		Bassically I am young programming entuhusiast who would like to begin career in IT and decided that the first step he should take would be to learn how to program and lo and behold I have, I must however thank <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>, without a doubt I couldn't have done it without that website. I must also thank <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools</a>, it really helped me with those things I just couldn't rememmber. <br><br><br>
		As I am sure you can all see the company <a href="http://www.twitter.co.uk/xyutonet">Twitter</a> feed to the right, this is just an easy way to broadcast the things I am doing and It is also a way of getting quick updates onto the site without having to go through commiting  and the like with <a href="http://www.github.com">. Github</a><br><br><br>
		Not only do I enjoy the programming and software side of technology I also enjoy playing around with hardware and have tried out many things using my Raspberry Pi. They are a great little devie and if you want to find out more, press <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">here</a>.</h3>
