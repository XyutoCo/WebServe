		Hello, this is the Code section of the company website, this is basically just a hub and 		there are a number of sub-page links to different sections based on different programming 		languages, for the moment this is just HTML and  Javascript, now of course I hope this will 		increase to more languages but for the time bieng this is all.
	<br>
		Links:
	<br><br>
		<a href="html.html">HTML/CSS</a>
	<br><br>
		For those who don't know, this is the coding language used to create websites, this can be 		combined with Javascript and PHP to make the more complicated websites that we know and use 		today.
	<br><br>
		<a href="javascript.html">Javascript</a>
	<br><br>
		This as said previously is  a language used alongside HTML to make the websites active, 		unfortunately because it is not a server side language, there is a limit as to what it can 		do. 
	<br><br>
		I suggest if you are interested in learning a programming language you should visit <a 		href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>, they have made courses that are easy to follow 		and really a good first step into programming.
	<br><br>
		As I am sure you can all see the company <a 		href="http://www.twitter.co.uk/xyutonet">Twitter</a> feed to the right, this is just an easy 		way to broadcast the things I am doing and It is also a way of getting quick updates onto the 		site without having to go through commiting  and the like with <a href="http://www.github.com"> 		Github</a>
	<br><br>
		I hope you enjoy the site and come back to see more.
