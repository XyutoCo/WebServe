			<h1>Pros and Cons of Overclocking a CPU</h1>
			<h3>Author: Callum Potter | Date: 16 June 2015</h3>
			<div id="page-content">
<h4>
			The Asus rampage line from the republic of gamers has recently been put 
			under my radar as the best motherboard on the current commercial market. 
			Whilst the heavy price drags it down if you’re looking to break record 
			this is recommended for you.
</h4>
<h4>
			One of its most valuable qualities has to be the detail put into the thing
			 they call “the overclocking armoury”. The special designed Haswell 22nm 
			 chip boards provide very well designed and fast power. In my other blog 
			 I mentioned about the risk of overclocking processors well the rampage has 
			 extra sets of pins which means the voltage load of the cpu it drastically 
			 change meaning there is little to no change in voltage making overclocking 
			 a lot safer. With the supplied oc panel this overclocking becomes the easiest
			  it can be. The OC panel allows for alterations to fanRPM, instant clock change
			   and a display of the processors temperature to ensure it isn’t damaged. With 
			   its own inbuilt sound card and Ethernet connecter both with extremely promising
			    specification’s and heck even the card is made of nickel to stop static build 
			    up and the layout of RMA is designed to maximise output and 20x faster than SSD.
</h4>
<h4>
			However of course this isn’t going to be cheap. Starting retail prices at lowest are
			 around £350-£500 which may sound a lot for a simple motherboard but trust me for what 
			 it’s worth I would defiantly recommend this.
</h4>
<h4>
 			Here is a list of the specs and extra information:
	<ul>
<li>Intel® Core™ i7 processors on LGA 2011-v3 socket</li>
<li>Intel X99 Express chipset</li>
<li>OC Socket, OC Panel, Safe Boot and ReTry buttons – Powerful tuning kit for breaking records</li>
<li>Extreme Engine Digi+ IV – Primo components for rock-steady power</li>
<li>DirectCU, X-Socket II, multiple thermal sensors and Fan Xpert 3 – Stay even cooler</li>
<li>PCI Express 3.0 x4 M.2, dual SATA Express, 3T3R 802.11ac Wi-Fi – Unparalleled connectivity with blistering-fast transfer speeds</li>
<li>SupremeFX 2014, Sonic Radar II, Intel Ethernet, LANGuard, GameFirst III, KeyBot, RAMDisk – Hear more, banish lag, accelerate loading and control</li>
	</ul>
