			<h1>Pros and Cons of Overclocking a CPU</h1>
			<h3>Author: Callum Potter | Date: 16 June 2015</h3>
			<div id="page-content">
			<h4>Sometimes with computers the CPU can become old. 
			Stop working fast or just not be able to perform tasks you need to.
			 Well say hello to the new trend CPU overclocking. With just a few 
			 simple steps you can turn a lousy 2.55GHz processor into 3!!! 
			 (Terms and conditions apply)<h4>
			<h4>
How many times have you seen something that sound like this? 
A few maybe none? Well that's because of the extremely large risks 
it can pose to computers which can sometimes lead to processors literally 
melting and yes they can I've seen it before and it was dark. So in the light 
I hope to persuade you to see the great benefits overclocking can have.
</h4>
<h4>
First to outline the risks:
<ul>
	<li>Inadequate temperature control or power supply may result in a decrease in performance or possibly even failure.</li>
	<li>A slight decrease in lifespan (not you of course. Well maybe...)</li>
	<li>Don't expect an amazing increase.</li>
</ul>
</h4>
<h4>
Now firstly you will need some sort of programme or way of overclocking it. 
Beforehand check the temperature and power usage of the CPU. If it is getting too
 hot you may need to install more fans or if you want to a water cooling system. 
 These will ensure the processor continues and performs as best as possible. A large
  voltage may also fry it so check it is well within the regions. Slowly increase the 
  clock speed over a few remembering to stay within what you have got. Once you've gone
   far you're too late so don't go to fast. After a while you should have a well overclocked
    processor which is nicely fitted and should run smoothly.
</h4>
<h4>
If you do accidently take it too far most Intel processors have a warranty which allows you
 to get it fixed or possibly a new one.
</h4>
<h4>
So what are you waiting for? Go and overclock it now.
